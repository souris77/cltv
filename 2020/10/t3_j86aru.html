<p>就像受人尊敬的特朗普在推特说的那样，是中国的错。中国会为他们对美国和这个世界做的付出代价。操他妈的，如果我在舰队时看到一个美籍芝麻人（大概，这个chinkhead motherfucker到底范围多大，内涵是什么俺也不知道）我会让他说556。（北约通用花生米口径）</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

Seriously, some people fucking use fucking foul language, is that really fucking so bad? People fucking use it for emphasis or sometimes fucking to be hateful. It is never fucking going to go away though. This is fucking just how the fucking world, and the fucking internet is. Oh, and your fucking PSA? Don't get me fucking started. Don't you fucking realize that fucking people can fucking multitask and fucking focus on multiple fucking things? People don't fucking want to focus on the fucking important shit 100% of the fucking time. Sometimes it's nice to just fucking sit back and fucking relax. Try it sometimes, you might fucking enjoy it. I am a bot</p>

        <p><strong>Hello.</strong></p>
<p>I noticed you dropped 3 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

It is never fucking going to go away though. This is fucking just how the fucking world, and the fucking internet is. Oh, and your fucking PSA? Don't get me fucking started. Don't you fucking realize that fucking people can fucking multitask and fucking focus on multiple fucking things? People don't fucking want to focus on the fucking important shit 100% of the fucking time. Sometimes it's nice to just fucking sit back and fucking relax.

<p>I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

<p>I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.</p>
<p>Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.</p>

        <p>他很老吗，我怎么感觉他心智12-15岁的样子。如果他干了就是犯罪，法庭审判进监狱。没干一张嘴，你也不能拿他怎么样，不能因言获罪。笑一笑就得了。</p>
<p>这种白人垃圾有很多，而且以后也不会少，哪里都会有，哪个种族都会有。抛开中国人干的那么多破事造成的名声。就算没干，人本来就是败坏的，我们无法选择别人怎么看自己，就像我无法100%保证我对任何种族都没有歧视潜意识。除非人人大脑都被管控（matrix、1984的世界也许就没有了）。</p>
<p>你盯着这种垃圾看的难受，不如让自己内心刚强一些，笑一笑就好，去交几个真正好的美国朋友，远离垃圾。</p>
