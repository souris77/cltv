    <strong>[Repost] Top 10 reasons to support HUAWEI</strong>
    <p><p>Huawei is banned in the United States. The Apple 12 is about to go on the marketl soon. </p>
<p>This is the time for us to f show.! If not one Apple mobile phone can be sold in the Chinese market on the day of release, the US will have no face.!!  </p>
<p>It's time for us to do something, insist on not buying Apple 12. </p>
<p>Since I started, everyone has join with  patriotism for China and love the party. </p>
<p>Let the United States be defeated without a fight. There are now tens of millions of people forwarding to the Chinese people on the Internet. </p>
<p>This  publicity won't fail!! Let us start doing something. China's  domestic mobile phones are really good, use Huawei P40:-</p>
<p>1) Has a master key, you be connected to the Internet everywhere, in hotels and other places without having to ask anyone for a password to connect.</p>
<p>2) Yes, you can log in to 2 WeChat at the same time.</p>
<p>3) It is a Leica dual-lens photo camera. The effect is the same as the SLR effect. It is a real Leica camera.</p>
<p>4) It has the world's 1st virtual 3-antenna reception. If you reach an area with very poor network coverage, you will still feel good.</p>
<p>5) Is cheaper, 2/3 of Apple's, and much cheaper than Samsung. P40 5G full Netcom is only 5988 Yuan, cost effective.</p>
<p>6) Is easy to download without ID code and password.</p>
<p>7) Is fast, P40 is 8G + 512GB.</p>
<p>8) The most exciting is that Huawei’s mobile phone is implanted with a Beidou chip by end of June '20 to face hundreds of millions of delighted shareholders.</p>
<p>9) There is no need to pay for phone calls and data charges for life. When the chip is installed, no card is needed.</p>
<p>10) Because the chip is satellite based communication, it will receive the high up satellite signals everywhere, is beyond imagination.</p>
<p>11) We support Made in China products.</p>
<p>12) To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation at an early date.</p>
<p>13) Is to weaken the arrogance of the United States, which is the most crucial.</p>
<p>Please repost to 50 people to win this war. If you see this message, no matter how busy you are, please forward it!</p>
