    <strong>[China Inside] The menu post for China Inside</strong>
    <p><p>A nice friend has suggested me to create a menu post, so I could keep everything in order. After all, China has many sides. This menu post could help you to collectively view things that were previously hidden away from other countries, and that is why they're called China Inside. And I hope the world could focus on something different, focus more.</p>
<p>In the future, I'd update this menu post by adding links if I create new sub posts, by the latest order.</p>
<p>The contents might be random, cause I have no specific plan on what I'm going to translate. Our society, people, culture and, of course, the current regime, CCP government. Some might be surprisingly heart warming while some...well, you know.</p>
<p>Btw, I can't guarantee how long or how often I'd do this. It's only a new hobby for an upset Chinese before he gets himself into jail.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoy.</p>
