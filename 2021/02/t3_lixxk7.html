    <strong>（CCJ评论）Wasting time as a society</strong>
    <p><p>As one does when they drink too much and need to sign their name into a loosely enforced sign-in registrar where the baoan has no means of verifying identity, there is time for reflection. Post Covid, I have done this a lot. As most baoan's have little grasp of English I've adpoted a Prince-inspired naming convention, in part because I hold a pen less than three times per week, while my right hand inscribes a small picture of involuntary thought on the box of the page of the sign-in book which is far too small to write any name in a western script.</p>
<p>The baoan has authority for 20 seconds until a representative of someone that pays their salary comes to pick me up. That's their 20-second chance to not be on the bottom of the food chain.</p>
<p>I have several friends that are teachers, doctors (I do not teach doctors), public service workers. This is their experience, and my numbers.</p>
<p>In a city of 10 million, there are around 1 million school age students and public service workers.</p>
<p>They have 3-4 people living with them - kids, parents, grandparents, siblings, just a guess at an average. So, that's 3-4 million people that need to send a health code to their school or workplace every day. A screenshot. Sometimes from two ayepeepee providers. Not even sent to the workplace or school, to a delegated worker or parent that needs to check and aggregate this, so that's several hundred checks per day per delegated parent.</p>
<p>Around 30 seconds to send the code per person. So, that's 90,000,000 seconds per reasonably large city per day, just sending it. That's 25,000 hours. Per day.</p>
<p>Anyone that's done a rudimentary level of technology will understand the workplace, or even throwing the boat out there, the local government, could query the database with a one line statement. And this is done, check your WeChat for your [local city name]waishi account, there's a daily update of no change in numbers.</p>
<p>25,000 hours per day could be saved by just pressing a button running an automated query WHICH IS ALREADY DONE BY ANOTHER AGENCY.</p>
<p>I am not the first to have this observation. It happens all over: Meet with your manager? No, you have a middle person to deal with the foreigner. But it's far from foreigner exclusive, all staff have the middle person, grafting and shifting, telling their story selectively as they see it.</p>
<p>Please don't get me wrong. There's a value in contact tracing. This is not how to do it. This is Chinese management in delegation. Just as the security guard asking for sign-in, push any aspect of accountability down to the level that it can't be pushed down to further. Then they're accountable.</p>

<p>I may come back to edit when less pissed off.</p></p>
