    <strong>(CCJ) Harmonious healthcare</strong>
    <p><p>Pandemic has prevented me from getting a prescription refill in freedom guo. Ask viv for help booking a number. Number booked. Show up late because of Viv people time. Go to all in one touch screen kiosk. ERROR foreign names meibanfa. Visit the appropriate empty window. NO NO NO USE ANOTHER KIOSK TO GET NUMBER FIRST! scan QR code. Wait 2 minutes for new number to be generated. Visit same counter. Get QR code receipt. Go to second floor. Insert card and QR code magic outside of doctors office.</p>
<p>Wait 5 minutes. Full name is displayed for a full waiting room to see with two ** in my 14+ character name. Privacy with chinese characteristics.</p>
<p>When my number comes up my full name is robo-read without the ** because not zhongwen.</p>
<p>Viv starts giving her version of the situation, totally diffrent than what I asked her to explain. Know enough zhongwen to know she's doing her shit not my plan but not enough to interrupt and do things my way. Things get more and more intimate and deeply personal, when old dude one forces his way into the room, at peak privacy invasion moment. Doctor tells him that the sign is correct and they are serving number 6 and that he needs to wait for 66 to be called. Things get even more deeply private and old couple two bust in asking if number 7 has been called. Doctor explains no number 6 is being served. Viv continues detailing very personal medical things with old couple two still in the room. Interject, tell old people to zou kai!, they leave consultation continues. Hear the chinese transliteration of the prescription I wanted refilled, ears perk up "Keyi keyi (rough transliteration of the medicine I wanted) shi dui de yao--" Interrupted by Viv and doctor who immediately switch to localhua ( why this didn't happen before I have no idea). Sit there like an immigrant at the DMV for a few minutes. Viv and doctor start cackling about something. Switch back to putonghua yada yada yada, come back in two weeks, yada yada. Button is pressed, old couple two come barging in, and Viv asks me "any questions? I'll tell you what she said later" tell the doctor sheee sheee.</p>
<p>Visit giant touch screen payment kiosk. After fucking around for a few minutes realize that the cost has been automatically deducted from my account and the kiosk was unnecessary. Apparently the yisheng glossed over this detail.</p>
<p>Go back to the first floor. Go to the pharmacy with new receipt. get told NO NO NO SCAN THE QR CODE GET A NUMBER. Get a number. Wait 2 minutes. Correct medication at wrong dosage is dispensed. Explain issue to Viv. "TAI FAN LE, we come back next time and explain again we good for now right?"</p>
<p>Cha bu duo.</p></p>
