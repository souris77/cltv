    <strong>夜深了人静了 天冷买不起煤啊 和鼠鼠们分享一首诗</strong>
    <p><p>搏击俱乐部有句话说的很中肯，It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything. 还是不能太物质了，一代又一代生来生去周而复始还是那个样子。各种攀比互害谁又能快乐地活在当下呢。 还是努力置身事外吧，当一个anyone, 遇见那个noone.</p>
<p>anyone lived in a pretty how town</p>
<p>by E.E. Cummings</p>
<p>anyone lived in a pretty how town 
(with up so floating many bells down)
spring summer autumn winter 
he sang his didn't he danced his did</p>
<p>Women and men (both little and small) 
cared for anyone not at all 
they sowed their isn't they reaped their same 
sun moon stars rain</p>
<p>children guessed (but only a few 
and down they forgot as up they grew 
autumn winter spring summer) 
that noone loved him more by more</p>
<p>when by now and tree by leaf
she laughed his joy she cried his grief 
bird by snow and stir by still 
anyone's any was all to her</p>
<p>someones married their everyones 
laughed their cryings and did their dance
(sleep wake hope and then) 
they said their nevers they slept their dream</p>
<p>stars rain sun moon
(and only the snow can begin to explain 
how children are apt to forget to remember 
with up so floating many bells down)</p>
<p>one day anyone died i guess 
(and noone stooped to kiss his face) 
busy folk buried them side by side 
little by little and was by was</p>
<p>all by all and deep by deep 
and more by more they dream their sleep 
noone and anyone earth by april 
wish by spirit and if by yes</p>
<p>Women and men (both dong and ding) 
summer autumn winter spring 
reaped their sowing and went their came
sun moon stars rain</p></p>
