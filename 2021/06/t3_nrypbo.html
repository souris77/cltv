    <strong>Harm of Great Firewall</strong>
    <p><p>Americans have underestimated the effect Great Firewall of CCP has in covering up. Great Firewall suppressed truths or scandals of China companies listed in USA and China operation of US corps, NBA and Hollywood distorting securities price before covid outbreak.  Great Firewall of Communist China not only covers up the spread of the Wuhan virus, but also distorts international financial market giving rise to financial fraud, securities manipulation and hampering monitoring conduct of American companies with operations in China. </p>
<p>Besides, due to Great Firewall, Mainland Chinese didn't know what happened in Hong Kong, Xinjiang and even in Beijing as of 4 June 1989 or Famine in Sichuan as of 1960. CCP is responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of Sichuanese in 1960 Famine. </p>
<p>Most American corps with Chinese operation paid their executives with share-based scheme. Censored information in China inflated management compensation by overvaluing share price and increased wealth gap in USA. </p>
<p>That's interesting. It's unknown how many their pollution, forced demolition, sex abuses, labour abuses, overstated seats and customer protest incidents incurred in China were suppressed by CCP with Great Firewall leading to overvaluated share price. Apple censors Chinese apps.</p></p>
