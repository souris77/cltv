    <strong>普丁你妈在路上被 200 条狗同时插爆 B，流得满路黑紫色的血，还有你妈烂掉的半边 B</strong>
    <p><p>大言不惭说什么</p>
<p>&rt;Since time immemorial, the people living in the southwest of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia — by separating, severing what is historically Russian land.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;…<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Ukrainian authorities — I would like to emphasize this — began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism.</p>
<p>知道什么叫基辅罗斯吗？</p>
<p>乌克兰人就是俄罗斯人？你俄罗斯人才是基辅子孙！区区罗习亚蛮子敢侵略我大基辅罗斯。I'm angry!</p>
<p>&rt;It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence. As we can see, this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the C.P.S.U. leadership, mistakes committed at different times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the U.S.S.R. is on their conscience.</p>
<p>原来普大大也觉得苏联「竟无一人是男儿」啊？真是狗熊所见略同。</p>
<p>&rt;They prefer not to acknowledge this, there is no genocide perpetrated against 14 million people.</p>
<p>宣称乌克兰对俄罗斯人实施种族屠杀⋯⋯普丁是不是去了一趟新疆学习先进经验？</p>
<p>&rt;The Kyiv authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice of the people, which is why they have opted for aggressive action, for activating extremist cells, including radical Islamist organizations, for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities, and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security services.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In fact, this is nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia.</p>
<p>收收汁味吧。</p>
<p>&rt;Once again, they threatened us with sanctions. They will still impose those, the stronger and more powerful our country becomes. They will always find an excuse to introduce more sanctions regardless of the situation in Ukraine. The only goal they have is to contain the development of Russia.</p>
<p>嗯嗯，我知道。有经验。词我都背熟啦。厉害了我的俄国！</p>
<p>&rt;Now, almost every day, they are shelling settlements. They have amassed large troops. They are using vehicles and other heavy machinery. They are torturing people, children, women, elderly people. It does not stop. We have seen no end to it.</p>
<p>你是在说你自己吗？</p>
<p>我算是清楚了：支那就是习朝鲜，罗斯就是北支那。</p>
<p>这实在是太荒谬了。<em>NYT</em> 讲述了真实的情况：</p>
<p>&rt;Mr. Putin’s speech culminates by describing an entirely false Ukrainian military assault on the country’s separatist-held east. In reality, in advance of his speech, Russia-backed forces shelled territory along the line of control between Ukrainian and separatist forces.</p>
