    <strong>his tragic scene took place in France recently. Kneeling down, it's a French Catholic priest</strong>
    <p><p>Once, they were spiritual mentors for many westerners; But now they kneel in front of so many people.</p>
<p>This tragic scene took place in France recently. Kneeling down, it's a French Catholic priest.</p>
<p>But they are not innocent, because many of their colleagues are really wolves in sheep's clothing.</p>
<p>It was a shocking scandal, so to speak. According to an independent Commission in France, at least 216,000 children were sexually abused by church clergy between 1950 and 2020.</p>
<p>Please note: 216,000, and it's a child, it's a sexual assault.</p>
<p>Where is child protection? Where are human rights?</p>
<p>Not to mention, the sexual abuse was committed by people who respected the clergy.</p>
<p>Even more infuriating is the fact that the truth, for decades, has been hidden under a veil of silence. So much so that the Pope, at the Vatican, declared after the report was released that he was "saddened" by it.</p>
<p>French society is furious at this systematic crime. Under pressure, the 120 clergy knelt in public this weekend in Lourdes, France, and begged for mercy.</p>
<p>The day's ceremony also included a ceremony to unveil a photo of a "crying child."</p></p>
