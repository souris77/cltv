<p>violence or even, some claim, civil war, which would force </p>

<p>would have a major impact on Russia's defense industry, </p>
<p>Russian-Ukrainian family connections, and bilateral relations </p>
<p>generally.  In Georgia, the GOR fears continued instability </p>
<p>and "provocative acts" in the separatist regions.  End </p>
<p>summary. </p>
<p>MFA: NATO Enlargement "Potential Military Threat to Russia" </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------- -------------- </p>
<ol>
<li>(U) During his annual review of Russia's foreign policy </li>
</ol>
<p>January 22-23 (ref B), Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed that </p>
<p>Russia had to view continued eastward expansion of NATO, </p>
<p>particularly to Ukraine and Georgia, as a potential military </p>
<p>threat.  While Russia might believe statements from the West </p>
<p>that NATO was not directed against Russia, when one looked at </p>
<p>recent military activities in NATO countries (establishment </p>
<p>of U.S. forward operating locations, etc. they had to be </p>
<p>evaluated not by stated intentions but by potential.  Lavrov </p>
<p>stressed that maintaining Russia's "sphere of influence" in </p>
<p>the neighborhood was anachronistic, and acknowledged that the </p>
<p>U.S. and Europe had "legitimate interests" in the region. </p>
<p>But, he argued, while countries were free to make their own </p>
<p>decisions about their security and which political-military </p>
<p>structures to join, they needed to keep in mind the impact on </p>
<p>their neighbors. </p>
<ol>
<li>(U) Lavrov emphasized that Russia was convinced that </li>
</ol>
<p>enlargement was not based on security reasons, but was a </p>
<p>legacy of the Cold War.  He disputed arguments that NATO was </p>
<p>an appropriate mechanism for helping to strengthen democratic </p>
<p>governments.  He said that Russia understood that NATO was in </p>
<p>search of a new mission, but there was a growing tendency for </p>
<p>new members to do and say whatever they wanted simply because </p>
<p>they were under the NATO umbrella (e.g. attempts of some new </p>
<p>member countries to "rewrite history and glorify fascists"). </p>
<ol>
<li>(U) During a press briefing January 22 in response to a </li>
</ol>
<p>question about Ukraine's request for a MAP, the MFA said "a </p>
<p>radical new expansion of NATO may bring about a serious </p>
<p>political-military shift that will inevitably affect the </p>
<p>security interests of Russia."  The spokesman went on to </p>
<p>stress that Russia was bound with Ukraine by bilateral </p>
<p>obligations set forth in the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, </p>
<p>Cooperation and Partnership in which both parties undertook </p>
<p>to "refrain from participation in or support of any actions </p>
<p>capable of prejudicing the security of the other Side."  The </p>
<p>spokesman noted that Ukraine's "likely integration into NATO </p>
<p>would seriously complicate the many-sided Russian-Ukrainian </p>
<p>relations," and that Russia would "have to take appropriate </p>
<p>measures."  The spokesman added that "one has the impression </p>
<p>that the present Ukrainian leadership regards rapprochement </p>
<p>with NATO largely as an alternative to good-neighborly ties </p>
<p>with the Russian Federation." </p>
<p>Russian Opposition Neuralgic and Concrete </p>
<p>----------------------------------------- </p>
<ol>
<li>(C) Ukraine and Georgia's NATO aspirations not only touch </li>
</ol>
<p>a raw nerve in Russia, they engender serious concerns about </p>
<p>the consequences for stability in the region.  Not only does </p>
<p>Russia perceive encirclement, and efforts to undermine </p>
<p>Russia's influence in the region, but it also fears </p>
<p>unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences which would </p>
<p>seriously affect Russian security interests.  Experts tell us </p>
<p>that Russia is particularly worried that the strong divisions </p>
<p>in Ukraine over NATO membership, with much of the </p>
<p>ethnic-Russian community against membership, could lead to a </p>
<p>major split, involving violence or at worst, civil war.  In </p>
<p>that eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to </p>
<p>intervene; a decision Russia does not want to have to face. </p>
<ol>
<li>(C) Dmitriy Trenin, Deputy Director of the Carnegie </li>
</ol>
<p>Moscow Center, expressed concern that Ukraine was, in the </p>
<p>long-term, the most potentially destabilizing factor in </p>
<p>U.S.-Russian relations, given the level of emotion and </p>
<p>neuralgia triggered by its quest for NATO membership.  The </p>
<p>letter requesting MAP consideration had come as a "bad </p>
<p>surprise" to Russian officials, who calculated that Ukraine's </p>
<p>NATO aspirations were safely on the backburner.  With its </p>
<p>public letter, the issue had been "sharpened."  Because </p>
<p>membership remained divisive in Ukrainian domestic politics, </p>
<p>it created an opening for Russian intervention.  Trenin </p>
<p>expressed concern that elements within the Russian </p>
<p>establishment would be encouraged to meddle, stimulating U.S. </p>
<p>overt encouragement of opposing political forces, and leaving </p>
<p>the U.S. and Russia in a classic confrontational posture. </p>
<p>The irony, Trenin professed, was that Ukraine's membership </p>
<p>would defang NATO, but neither the Russian public nor elite </p>
<p>opinion was ready for that argument.  Ukraine's gradual shift </p>
<p>towards the West was one thing, its preemptive status as a de </p>
<p>jure U.S. military ally another.  Trenin cautioned strongly </p>
<p>against letting an internal Ukrainian fight for power, where </p>
<p>MAP was merely a lever in domestic politics,  further </p>
<p>complicate U.S.-Russian relations now.</p>

        <ol>
<li>(C) Another issue driving Russian opposition to Ukrainian </li>
</ol>
<p>membership is the significant defense industry cooperation </p>
<p>the two countries share, including a number of plants where </p>
<p>Russian weapons are made.  While efforts are underway to shut </p>
<p>down or move most of these plants to Russia, and to move the </p>
<p>Black Sea fleet from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk earlier than </p>
<p>the 2017 deadline, the GOR has made clear that Ukraine's </p>
<p>joining NATO would require Russia to make major (costly) </p>
<p>changes to its defense industrial cooperation. </p>
<ol>
<li>(C) Similarly, the GOR and experts note that there would </li>
</ol>
<p>also be a significant impact on Russian-Ukrainian economic </p>
<p>and labor relations, including the effect on thousands of </p>
<p>Ukrainians living and working in Russia and vice versa, due </p>
<p>to the necessity of imposing a new visa regime.  This, </p>
<p>Aleksandr Konovalov, Director of the Institute for Strategic </p>
<p>Assessment, argued, would become a boiling cauldron of anger </p>
<p>and resentment among the local population. </p>
<ol>
<li>(C) With respect to Georgia, most experts said that while </li>
</ol>
<p>not as neuralgic to Russia as Ukraine, the GOR viewed the </p>
<p>situation there as too unstable to withstand the divisiveness </p>
<p>NATO membership could cause.  Aleksey Arbatov, Deputy </p>
<p>Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, argued that Georgia's </p>
<p>NATO aspirations were simply a way to solve its problems in </p>
<p>Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and warned that Russia would be </p>
<p>put in a difficult situation were that to ensue. </p>
<p>Russia's Response </p>
<p>----------------- </p>
<ol>
<li>(C) The GOR has made it clear that it would have to </li>
</ol>
<p>"seriously review" its entire relationship with Ukraine and </p>
<p>Georgia in the event of NATO inviting them to join.  This </p>
<p>could include major impacts on energy, economic, and </p>
<p>political-military engagement, with possible repercussions </p>
<p>throughout the region and into Central and Western Europe. </p>
<p>Russia would also likely revisit its own relationship with </p>
<p>the Alliance and activities in the NATO-Russia Council, and </p>
<p>consider further actions in the arms control arena, including </p>
<p>the possibility of complete withdrawal from the CFE and INF </p>
<p>Treaties, and more direct threats against U.S. missile </p>
<p>defense plans. </p>
<ol>
<li>(C) Isabelle Francois, Director of the NATO Information </li>
</ol>
<p>Office in Moscow (protect), said she believed that Russia had </p>
<p>accepted that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually join NATO </p>
<p>and was engaged in long-term planning to reconfigure its </p>
<p>relations with both countries, and with the Alliance. </p>
<p>However, Russia was not yet ready to deal with the </p>
<p>consequences of further NATO enlargement to its south.  She </p>
<p>added that while Russia liked the cooperation with NATO in </p>
<p>the NATO-Russia Council, Russia would feel it necessary to </p>
<p>insist on recasting the NATO-Russia relationship, if not </p>
<p>withdraw completely from the NRC, in the event of Ukraine and </p>
<p>Georgia joining NATO. </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>------- </p>
<ol>
<li>(C) Russia's opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine </li>
</ol>
<p>and Georgia is both emotional and based on perceived </p>
<p>strategic concerns about the impact on Russia's interests in </p>
<p>the region.  It is also politically popular to paint the U.S. </p>
<p>and NATO as Russia's adversaries and to use NATO's outreach </p>
<p>to Ukraine and Georgia as a means of generating support from </p>
<p>Russian nationalists.  While Russian opposition to the first </p>
<p>round of NATO enlargement in the mid-1990's was strong, </p>
<p>Russia now feels itself able to respond more forcefully to </p>
<p>what it perceives as actions contrary to its national </p>
<p>interests. </p>
